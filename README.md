# DSA Queue Simulator

##  Traffic Light Simulation using Queues
This project is a **traffic simulation** implemented in **C** using the **SDL2** library. It simulates a **four-way intersection** with vehicles moving in different directions, traffic lights, and queue-based vehicle management. The simulation is visualized in real-time using **SDL2's rendering capabilities**.

## Installations

### Prerequisites
Before running the simulation, ensure you have the following installed:
- A **C compiler** (e.g., `gcc` or `clang`)
- **SDL2** library and **SDL2 development headers**
- **Make** (for building the project)

### Steps to Install and Run
#### 1️. Clone the Repository
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/apekshyya/dsa-queue-simulator.git
$ cd dsa-queue-simulator
```

#### 2️. Install Required Libraries
**For macOS (Homebrew):**
```sh
$ brew install sdl2 sdl2_ttf
```
**For Ubuntu/Debian:**
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev
```

#### 3️. Compile and Run the Project
```sh
$ make          # Compile the project
$ make run      # Run both the generator and simulator
$ make clean    # Remove compiled files and data
```
To run them separately:
```sh
$ make run-generator  # Run the traffic generator
$ make run-simulator  # Run the traffic simulator
```

## Dependencies
- **SDL2**: Used for rendering the simulation and handling window management.
- **Standard C Libraries**: Used for I/O, memory management, and queue operations.
- **Make**: Automates the build process.

---
## Usage
The simulation runs in a **window** and displays **vehicles moving through a four-way intersection**. Traffic lights control the flow of vehicles, ensuring organized movement and realistic queuing behavior.

###  Controls
- **Close the Window**: Click the close button or press **ESC**.
- **Traffic Light Timing**: Traffic lights automatically switch every few seconds.

## Key Features
### 1. Vehicle Management
- Vehicles are represented as structures with properties like **position**, **speed**, and **lane**.
- A **queue system** manages vehicles entering and leaving the simulation.

### 2. Traffic Light Control
- Traffic lights switch states automatically at fixed intervals.
- Vehicles **stop** at red lights and **move** on green signals.

### 3. SDL2-Based Rendering
- **Real-time traffic visualization** with SDL2.
- Roads, lanes, and traffic lights are drawn dynamically.

### 4. Lane Prioritization
- Some lanes have higher priority depending on traffic rules.
- Vehicles in **non-priority lanes** must wait longer if there is congestion.
