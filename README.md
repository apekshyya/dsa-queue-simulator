# dsa-queue-simulator
Traffic Light Simulation using Queues : A mini project that simulates traffic management at a junction using linear data structures with optional priority handling for high-traffic lanes.

##Descriptions :

This traffic simulation project developed in C language that implements queue data structures and uses SDL2 for visualization.This project consists of two main components:
1. A traffic generator that creates traffic patterns
2. A simulator that visualizes traffic flow using SDL2 graphics

The simulation demonstrates the practical application of queue data structures in traffic management, handling vehicle movement across multiple lanes.

##Components
1. Traffic Generator: Creates traffic patterns and writes them to lane files (laneA.txt, laneB.txt, laneC.txt, laneD.txt)
2. Traffic Simulator: Reads the generated traffic data, implements queue operations, and visualizes traffic using SDL2

##Prerequisites:
1. C compiler (Clang recommended)
2. SDL2 and SDL2_ttf libraries
3. Make
